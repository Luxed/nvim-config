# TODO

- Look into making a better source for ALE to work with NCM2. Currently with the omni function it randomly locks up in typescript.
- Look into the bugs encountered with ALE and deoplete (suggestions slowly disapearing the more you type)
- Improve dracula for pandoc (conceal), python

## Plugins to look into

- nvim-gdb
- vim-obsession
- session.vim
- stop being a whiny bitch and use coc.nvim. ALE+Deoplete or even ncm2 will never be as good

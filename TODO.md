# TODO

- Look into making a better source for ALE to work with NCM2. Currently with the omni function it randomly locks up in typescript.
- Look into the bugs encountered with ALE and deoplete (suggestions slowly disapearing the more you type)

## Plugins to look into

- nvim-gdb
- vim-obsession
- session.vim

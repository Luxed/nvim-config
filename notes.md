# Interesting plugins

- nvim-gdb
- vim-open-color
- vim-obsession + vim-prosession
- vim-markdown-composer

# TODO

- Replace Fzf by other fuzzy finder (vim-clap? Only replaces external dependency (program that I don't use but maybe should) with an optional rust dependency)
- Move some plugin configurations to own files (in autoload or in new directory with dynamic loading)

# Neovim 0.5 features

- nvim-treesitter
- nvim-lsp
- completion-nvim
- diagnostic-nvim
